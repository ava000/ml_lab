    "#### Step 1: Create the dependent variable\n",
    "- First of all, we need to generate a categorical variable which indicates whether an order has been returned or not.\n",
    "- ***Hint:*** the returned orders’ IDs are contained in the dataset “returns”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2:\n",
    "- Your manager believes that **how long it took the order to ship** would affect whether the customer would return it or not. \n",
    "- He wants you to generate a feature which can measure how long it takes the company to process each order.\n",
    "- ***Hint:*** Process.Time = Ship.Date - Order.Date\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a product has been returned before, it may be returned again. \n",
    "- Let us generate a feature indictes how many times the product has been returned before.\n",
    "- If it never got returned, we just impute using 0.\n",
    "- ***Hint:*** Group by different Product.ID\n",

    "\n",
    "- You can use any binary classification method you have learned so far.\n",
    "- Use 80/20 training and test splits to build your model. \n",
    "- Double check the column types before you fit the model.\n",
    "- Only include useful features. i.e all the `ID`s should be excluded from your training set.\n",
    "- Note that there are only less than 5% of the orders have been returned, so you should consider using the [createDataPartition](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caret/versions/6.0-80/topics/createDataPartition) function from `caret` package and [StratifiedKfold](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html#sklearn-model-selection-stratifiedkfold) from sklearn when running cross-validation.\n",
    "- Do forget to `set.seed()` before the spilt to make your result reproducible.\n",
    "- **Note:** We are not looking for the best tuned model in the lab so don't spend too much time on grid search. Focus on model evaluation and the business use case of each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 6: Evaluating Models\n",
    "- What is the best metric to evaluate your model. Is accuracy good for this case?\n",
    "- Now you have multiple models, which one would you pick? \n",
    "- Can you get any clue from the confusion matrix? What is the meaning of precision and recall in this case? Which one do you care the most? How will your model help the manager make decisions?\n",
    "- **Note:** The last question is open-ended. Your answer could be completely different depending on your understanding of this business problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 7: Feature Engineering Revisit\n",
    "- Is there anything wrong with the new feature we generated? How should we fix it?\n",
    "- ***Hint***: For the real test set, we do not know it will get returned or not."
